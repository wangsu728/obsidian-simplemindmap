Provides a user-friendly mind map plugin for Obsidian.

The mind map functionality is built upon the [mind-map](https://github.com/wanglin2/mind-map) project, which offers a JavaScript mind map library and a complete online version.

mind-map also provides a standalone mind map client. Learn more about the [Client](https://github.com/wanglin2/mind-map/releases).
