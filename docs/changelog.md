# v0.0.0

1:  
- Save files in Markdown format as `.smm.md`. The "More" menu in the top-right corner now supports switching to Markdown editing mode.  
- Node hyperlinks now support linking to Obsidian (`.md`) files.  
- Split-view mode now synchronizes the mind map’s core data (basic configurations and settings are not synchronized).  
- Clicking the save button in the top-right stores the current preview image, which can then be embedded into Markdown documents using `![[.smm.md]]` to display as an image. The image updates in real time when the source file is modified, and double-clicking the image opens the mind map editor.  
- Node statistics have been added to the bottom status bar.  
- A basic multilingual setting has been implemented.

2:  
- Mind map and SVG data are now compressed and encoded before saving.  
- Fixed duplicate entries for the **Open as Markdown Document** option in the top-right "More" menu.  
- Mind map settings are now persisted across sessions.  
- Added settings for specifying mind map file path, image file path, default structure, default theme, and auto-save interval.  
- Theme mode can now be set to: Follow Obsidian, Dark, or Light.  
- Files are automatically saved before closing a tab to prevent data loss.  
- Uploaded node and background images are stored in the vault; only file paths are saved in the mind map data to reduce file size.  
- Node images can now be selected directly from images already in the vault.  
- Embedded previews now use PNG instead of SVG. This significantly reduces saved data size but sacrifices SVG’s high resolution.  
- Added **Copy as Obsidian Internal Link** to the canvas right-click menu.  
- Added a "Saving..." indicator next to the save button.  
- Node text input now supports typing `[[` to trigger a popup listing Obsidian files for inserting internal links.  
- Obsidian files in the hyperlink dialog now support search.  
- Notification messages and tooltips have been migrated from Element UI to Obsidian’s native components.  
- Theme colors now follow Obsidian’s theme; non-Element UI component colors dynamically adapt to Obsidian’s theme.  
- Added a button in the top-right corner to switch to outline editing mode.

3:  
- **Multilingual support**:  
  - Automatically follows Obsidian’s language setting.  
  - Plugin code now fully supports Chinese, English, Vietnamese, and Traditional Chinese.  
- Image upload dialog for node images now supports dragging images directly from the Obsidian file list.  
- Pasted images are now automatically saved as files in the vault.  
- Added **Copy as Obsidian Internal Link** to the node right-click menu; opening the link automatically focuses on that node.  
- **Internal Links**:  
  - Improved editing of rich-text internal links within nodes: during editing, raw syntax like `[[xxx]]` is shown; after editing, it renders as a clickable link. Supports suffixes like `#`, `^`, and `|`.  
  - Unified handling of internal links in both node hyperlinks and node text; updates are synchronized to the Markdown document.  
  - Fixed ambiguity when inserting internal links to files with identical names in different directories.  
  - Deduplication of internal links.  
- Support embedding SMM-language code blocks in Markdown documents:  
  - Simple mind map editing is possible within the code block; all keyboard shortcuts and rich-text toolbar functions are available.  
  - Initial height can be set and adjusted by dragging.  
  - Action buttons: Return to root node, Fit to canvas.  
  - Command: Insert a mind map code block into the current document.  
- File selection popups for node text now support keyboard navigation (arrow keys and Enter).  
- Fixed abnormal rendering in the minimap.  
- Fixed errors in presentation mode.  
- Outline view now supports displaying and adding internal links.  
- Improved UI styling, layout, and dark mode compatibility.

4:  
- When importing `.smm`, `.json`, or `.xmind` files, base64-encoded node images are converted and stored in the vault.  
- Hyperlink icons now visually distinguish between Obsidian files and web URLs.  
- When exporting to `.smm`, `.json`, or `.xmind`, images using Obsidian paths are converted to base64.  
- Added links in settings for submitting issues and downloading the desktop client.  
- Double-clicking an embedded preview without an image still navigates to the mind map editor.  
- Hyperlinks now support adding local files; selected files are uploaded to the vault, and the storage path can be customized in settings.  
- Image compression for uploads is now supported; compression settings (enabled/disabled and parameters) are configurable.  
- Added setting to control whether double-clicking an `![[]]` embedded preview opens in a new tab.  
- Added setting to toggle transparent background for embedded previews.  
- Mind map file storage directory can be set to: vault root, a specified folder, or the same folder as the current file.  
- Image and general file storage directories support four options: vault root, specified folder, current file’s folder, or a subfolder under the current file’s folder.  
- Added settings for prefix and datetime format in new mind map filenames.  
- Added onboarding guidance for first-time plugin users.

5:  
- Added setting to extend the list of fonts available in mind maps.  
- Directory inputs in settings now support selecting vault folders.  
- Markdown documents can now be previewed as mind maps, with options to switch structure/theme and export as PNG, SVG, or PDF.  
- Structure options in settings are now localized; single-type structures no longer show redundant index labels.  
- Added a read-only mode toggle button in the top-right corner.  
- If a mind map contains image data, embedded previews use PNG; otherwise, SVG is used. SVG previews support transparent backgrounds.  
- Code block embedding now supports toggling transparent background.  
- Code block embedding supports switching structure and theme.  
- Components are now imported on-demand to reduce bundle size and fix interference with Obsidian’s table styles.
